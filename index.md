## Welcome to Saizonic's Game Site!

Hello, my name is Steve Dufault and I am a game developer! I have loved games my entire life, and making them is one of the most rewarding things I do. Here you can find my original martial arts clicker prototype, Punch Clicker!

I am also currently working on a game called Incremedieval, a game about starting as a farmer in a medieval kingdom and working their way up to royalty across multiple generations!

### What is Punch Clicker?

Punch Clicker is a martial arts based incremental game where you as the fighter need to train to become stronger!

Implemented features include:
*   Gain Power by punching the bag or by being AFK!
*   Click on your master for tips!
*   Open the skill tree and learn new passive and active abilities!
*   Activate your active skills to increase your power further!
*   Move on to the next dojo by breaking the punching bag!
*   Learn the final skill in the 2nd dojo called Power Up!
*   Live Statistics about your gameplay!
*   Once you are done, Rebirth and do it all again but faster!

The game can be found [here](https://saizonic.github.io/punchclicker.html)!
